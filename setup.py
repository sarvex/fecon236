_______________|  fecon236/setup.py :: Installation via setuptools.

                  Essential install config file, esp. for pip.

   Dependencies:  setuptools>=38.6.0  [for markdown support]

                  (wheel>=0.31.0      [for markdown support] distribution)
                  (twine>=1.11.0      [for markdown support] PyPI submit)

VERSION in play:  Use "pip show fecon236"

           Rant:  pip CANNOT properly resolve dependencies!
                  Setting up installation is frustrating in the
                  complex Python ecosystem with magical incantations.

       For PyPI:  - Distinguish between "Universal" and "Pure" wheels.
                  - Create distribution wheels by:
                        pythonN setup.py bdist_wheel [--universal]
                  - dist/ will be under your project’s root directory.
                      - build/ and PROJECT.egg-info/ as well.
                  - To upload to PyPI:
                        twine upload dist/*
                  - Check up at https://pypi.org/project/PROJECT

#  What packages are required? For example:
#  'foo', 'bar>=2.0', 'foobar~=3.4.5'
#  ___ATTN___ But does this list start their installations??
#             How is this connected to requirements.txt??
#             What if prequisites are already furnished by Anaconda?
#  https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements
#  "Specify what a project MINIMALLY needs to run correctly.
#  When the project is installed by pip,
#  this is the specification that is used to install its dependencies.
#  NOT considered best practice to use install_requires to pin
#  dependencies to specific versions, or to specify sub-dependencies.
#  Note: install_requires is a listing of ABSTRACT requirements,
#  i.e just names and version restrictions that do not determine
#  where the dependencies will be fulfilled. The concreteness
#  will be determined at install time using pip options."
#          "Whereas "install_requires" defines the dependencies
#          for a single project, requirements.txt is used to define
#          requirements for a complete Python ENVIRONMENT.
#          Requirements files often contain an exhaustive listing
#          of pinned versions for the purpose of achieving
#          repeatable installations of a complete environment."
#  However, using "pip install -e . " which is short for --editable,
#  and "." refering to the current working directory, will install
#  the current directory (i.e. your project) in editable mode.
#  This will also INSTALL any dependencies declared with "install_requires"
#  and any scripts declared with "console_scripts".
#  Dependencies will be installed in the usual, non-editable mode.
#      If you don’t want to install any dependencies at all:
#              pip install -e . --no-deps

REQUIRED = []
#          ^Leave EMPTY instead of relying on --no-deps
#           (We do not want conflicts with conda installations.)

#  #   license=licensed,  # GOTCHA in setup
#  #
#  #  The "license" argument is for supplying the name of the software license
#  #  being used (e.g. 'MIT' or 'GPLv2'), NOT for supplying the entire text
#  #  of the license. If the text is included, setuptools' failure to indent
#  #  the license text causes all subsequent fields of the PKG-INFO
#  #  (including the long description and keywords) to not be parsed,
#  #  hence they will not show up correctly on PyPI.
